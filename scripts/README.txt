This folder (scripts) contains numerous Linux and Python
scripts. Each performs a specific action which is niche enough
to not be generally useful, but is performed by me enough to
warrant writing a script. These must be specially written for
each experiment, and must be run on a Linux machine with the
`fish` terminal installed (for `*.sh` scripts) and `python3`
(for *.py scripts).
